# StudyMaster AI - Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT FIXES APPLIED

### âœ… Critical Issues Fixed
- **Signup API**: Fixed to return complete user data with progress
- **Logout Issue**: Fixed white page by using `window.location.href` instead of router
- **Client-side Exceptions**: Added error boundaries and better hydration handling
- **localStorage Safety**: Added browser environment checks for all localStorage usage
- **Protected Routes**: Improved mounting and redirect logic
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error boundaries and fallbacks

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set `JWT_SECRET` with secure random string (32+ characters)
- [ ] Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to production domain
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`

### âœ… Database Setup
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster is running and accessible
- [ ] Database collections are created (users, tasks, sessions)
- [ ] Database indexes are optimized for queries
- [ ] Connection pooling is configured (max 10 connections for free tier)

### âœ… Build Verification
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in production build
- [ ] All API routes are functional
- [ ] Static assets are optimized

### âœ… Security Configuration
- [ ] JWT secrets are secure and unique for production

- [ ] Environment variables are not exposed to client
- [ ] Authentication middleware is working

## Deployment Steps

### Vercel Deployment
1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set output directory: `.next`
5. Deploy and test all functionality

### Environment Variables for Vercel
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_production_mongodb_connection

JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRATION=7d
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
```
