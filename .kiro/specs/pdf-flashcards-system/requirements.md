# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AI-powered flashcards system integrated directly into the Study Space that automatically generates concise, memorable flashcards from uploaded PDF documents. The system aims to reduce learner overwhelm by breaking down long study documents into bite-sized, contextually relevant flashcards that help students retain key information efficiently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Study Space Integration

**User Story:** As a student, I want to generate flashcards directly from my uploaded PDF in the Study Space, so that I can quickly create study materials without leaving my current study session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters the Study Space with an uploaded PDF THEN the system SHALL display a "Generate Flashcards" option prominently in the interface
2. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Flashcards" THEN the system SHALL parse the uploaded PDF content and extract text for AI processing
3. WHEN flashcard generation is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing generation progress
4. IF PDF content is insufficient (less than 100 characters) THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN flashcards are generated THEN the user SHALL be able to toggle between PDF view and Flashcard view within the same Study Space interface

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered Flashcard Generation

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to automatically create concise, accurate flashcards from my PDF content, so that I can focus on learning rather than manual card creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes PDF content THEN it SHALL extract key concepts, definitions, and important summaries using AI
2. WHEN generating flashcards THEN each card SHALL contain a Front (Question/Prompt) and Back (Answer/Explanation) with maximum 2 lines per side
3. WHEN creating flashcard content THEN the system SHALL ensure answers are simplified and easy to remember
4. WHEN processing long documents THEN the system SHALL limit generation to a maximum of 10-15 flashcards to prevent overwhelm
5. WHEN generating cards THEN the system SHALL include contextual information such as page numbers and source text references
6. IF AI generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback functionality or clear error messaging

### Requirement 3: Interactive Flashcard Viewing

**User Story:** As a student, I want to interact with generated flashcards in an intuitive, distraction-free interface, so that I can focus on memorization and retention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing flashcards THEN the interface SHALL display cards in a swipeable/navigable layout with clear visual design
2. WHEN interacting with a card THEN the user SHALL be able to flip cards to reveal answers with smooth animations
3. WHEN navigating flashcards THEN the user SHALL be able to move between cards using swipe gestures, arrow buttons, or keyboard shortcuts
4. WHEN viewing a flashcard THEN the interface SHALL show current position (e.g., "3 of 10") and navigation controls
5. WHEN in flashcard view THEN the user SHALL have a clear toggle option to instantly switch back to PDF view
6. WHEN displaying flashcards THEN the UI SHALL follow shadcn/ui styling with soft cards, rounded corners, and minimal distractions

### Requirement 4: Flashcard Actions and Status Management

**User Story:** As a student, I want to mark flashcards based on my learning progress, so that I can organize my study materials effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a flashcard THEN the user SHALL be able to mark it as "Save", "Known", or "Review Later"
2. WHEN marking a card as "Save" THEN it SHALL be visually indicated with a heart icon or similar save indicator
3. WHEN marking a card as "Known" THEN it SHALL be visually indicated and the user SHALL understand it won't appear in future review sessions
4. WHEN marking a card as "Review Later" THEN it SHALL be flagged for future study sessions
5. WHEN actions are performed THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for each action
6. WHEN multiple cards are marked THEN the system SHALL show a summary count of saved, known, and review cards

### Requirement 5: Flashcard Persistence and Storage

**User Story:** As a student, I want my saved flashcards to persist across sessions and be accessible from my dashboard, so that I can review them anytime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves flashcards THEN they SHALL be stored in the database with user ID, task ID, and timestamp
2. WHEN flashcards are saved THEN they SHALL include references to the originating PDF/task ID for context
3. WHEN storing flashcards THEN the system SHALL save creation timestamp and last review date
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN saved flashcards SHALL persist and remain accessible
5. WHEN accessing saved flashcards THEN they SHALL be viewable in a "Saved Flashcards" section under the dashboard
6. WHEN viewing saved flashcards THEN users SHALL be able to filter by status (saved, known, review) and search by content

### Requirement 6: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a student, I want the flashcard system to be fast and responsive, so that it doesn't interrupt my study flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating flashcards THEN the process SHALL complete within 30 seconds for typical PDF documents
2. WHEN switching between PDF and flashcard views THEN the transition SHALL be instant without page refresh
3. WHEN navigating between flashcards THEN each transition SHALL be smooth and responsive
4. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN it SHALL provide clear, user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN flashcards are generated THEN the console SHALL be clean with no errors or warnings
6. WHEN the feature is implemented THEN no unused code or imports SHALL remain in the codebase

### Requirement 7: Mobile and Accessibility Support

**User Story:** As a student using various devices, I want the flashcard system to work well on mobile and be accessible, so that I can study anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria
