# Database Migration Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating StudyMaster AI from a local MongoDB instance to a cloud-hosted database solution. This migration is critical for production deployment, scalability, and reliability. The migration must maintain all existing functionality while improving performance, security, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Service Selection

**User Story:** As a hackathon developer, I want to migrate to a free cloud database service that maintains compatibility with our existing MongoDB-based architecture, so that we can deploy our prototype without cost while preserving scalability options for future growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating cloud database options THEN the system SHALL prioritize services with generous free tiers that don't require credit cards
2. WHEN comparing services THEN the system SHALL prioritize free tier storage limits, connection limits, and no-cost deployment options
3. WHEN selecting a service THEN the system SHALL ensure the free tier can support hackathon demo requirements and initial user testing
4. WHEN choosing between services THEN the system SHALL prioritize MongoDB-compatible solutions to minimize code changes
5. WHEN evaluating scalability THEN the system SHALL ensure the chosen service provides clear upgrade paths if the prototype succeeds
6. WHEN documenting options THEN the system SHALL clearly identify which services require credit cards vs. those that are truly free to start

### Requirement 2: Codebase Analysis and Impact Assessment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive analysis of our current database usage patterns, so that I can understand the full scope of migration changes required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all database connection points and configuration files
2. WHEN reviewing data models THEN the system SHALL document all MongoDB collections, indexes, and relationships
3. WHEN examining queries THEN the system SHALL catalog all CRUD operations, aggregations, and MongoDB-specific features in use
4. WHEN assessing authentication THEN the system SHALL verify NextAuth.js integration and session storage dependencies
5. WHEN evaluating features THEN the system SHALL list all application features that depend on database operations
6. WHEN completing analysis THEN the system SHALL provide evidence-based recommendations with specific code references

### Requirement 3: Migration Strategy and Planning

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a detailed migration plan with clear phases and rollback procedures, so that I can execute the migration safely with minimal downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the migration plan THEN the system SHALL define clear phases: Preparation, Code Changes, Testing, and Deployment
2. WHEN planning code changes THEN the system SHALL identify all files requiring modification with specific change descriptions
3. WHEN designing the migration THEN the system SHALL ensure backward compatibility during transition period
4. WHEN planning deployment THEN the system SHALL include environment variable updates and configuration changes
5. WHEN creating the plan THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive testing procedures for all affected features
6. WHEN documenting the strategy THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed rollback plan in case of migration failure

### Requirement 4: Data Integrity and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure that all user data is migrated safely and securely without loss or corruption, so that users can continue their study progress seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL ensure 100% data integrity with verification procedures
2. WHEN transferring user data THEN the system SHALL maintain all user progress, achievements, and study history
3. WHEN handling authentication data THEN the system SHALL preserve all user accounts and session information
4. WHEN implementing security THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections and secure credential management
5. WHEN validating migration THEN the system SHALL include data comparison procedures between old and new databases
6. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL verify all gamification data (points, badges, levels) is preserved

### Requirement 5: Performance and Scalability for Hackathon Prototype

**User Story:** As a hackathon participant, I want the migrated database to provide adequate performance for demo purposes while ensuring we can scale if the prototype gains traction, so that we can focus on feature development rather than infrastructure concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating THEN the system SHALL provide acceptable response times for hackathon demo scenarios (under 500ms for typical queries)
2. WHEN configuring the free tier THEN the system SHALL optimize for the service's connection and storage limits
3. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL use minimal indexing sufficient for demo performance while staying within free tier limits
4. WHEN implementing the solution THEN the system SHALL support at least 10-50 concurrent demo users without degradation
5. WHEN planning for growth THEN the system SHALL document clear scaling strategies if the prototype requires more resources
6. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL include basic performance tracking suitable for identifying bottlenecks during demos

### Requirement 6: Environment Configuration and Deployment

**User Story:** As a hackathon developer, I want simple environment configuration procedures that work with free tier limitations, so that I can quickly deploy and demo the application without complex infrastructure setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring for hackathon THEN the system SHALL use a single database instance that can serve both development and demo purposes
2. WHEN updating configuration THEN the system SHALL require minimal environment variable changes (ideally just connection string)
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL provide simple, one-step deployment procedures suitable for hackathon timelines
4. WHEN setting up monitoring THEN the system SHALL use free tier monitoring tools and basic health checks
5. WHEN documenting access THEN the system SHALL provide straightforward credential management that doesn't require complex security infrastructure
6. WHEN planning for production THEN the system SHALL document how to separate environments if the prototype scales beyond hackathon phase

### Requirement 7: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing procedures to validate that all functionality works correctly after migration, so that we can confidently deploy to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing authentication THEN the system SHALL verify all login, signup, and session management functions work correctly
2. WHEN testing study features THEN the system SHALL validate AI-powered study sessions, quiz generation, and progress tracking
3. WHEN testing gamification THEN the system SHALL confirm points, badges, achievements, and level calculations are accurate
4. WHEN testing data operations THEN the system SHALL verify all CRUD operations function correctly with the new database
5. WHEN performing integration testing THEN the system SHALL test all API endpoints and user workflows end-to-end
6. WHEN load testing THEN the system SHALL validate performance under expected user loads

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

**User Story:** As a team member, I want comprehensive documentation of the new database setup and migration process, so that I can maintain and troubleshoot the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting the migration THEN the system SHALL provide complete setup instructions for new developers
2. WHEN creating operational docs THEN the system SHALL include database maintenance, backup, and monitoring procedures
3. WHEN documenting troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide common issue resolution guides
4. WHEN updating project docs THEN the system SHALL reflect all configuration and architecture changes
5. WHEN providing training materials THEN the system SHALL include database administration best practices
6. WHEN completing documentation THEN the system SHALL ensure all team members can independently work with the new setup
