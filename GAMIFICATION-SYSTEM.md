## üìä Point Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Perfect Study Session
- 30-minute session completed: 30 √ó 5 = **150 points**
- With 2x power-up active: 150 √ó 2 = **300 points**
- Quiz: 5 correct, 0 wrong, 0 reveals: 5 √ó 5 = **25 points**
- **Total: 325 points**

### Example 2: Early End with Penalties
- Session ended early: **-25 points**
- Quiz: 3 correct, 2 wrong, 1 reveal: (3√ó5) - (2√ó1) - (1√ó10) = **3 points**
- **Total: -22 points**

### Example 3: Level Up Scenario
- Current points: 95
- Complete 30-minute session: +150 points = 245 total
- Level up from 1 to 2: +100 bonus points = **345 total points**
- Now at Level 3 (245 + 100 = 345 points)
